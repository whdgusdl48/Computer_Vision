       " of omen which foretold the future , and was accordingly held in great respect by them . she was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself ; and , one day , seeing some travellers approaching , she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could . the travellers were in some dismay at the sound , for they feared it might be a bad omen ; till one of them , spying the crow , said to his companions , \" it\\'s all right , my friends , we can go on without fear , for it\\'s only a crow and that means nothing . \" . those who pretend to be something they are not only make . themselves ridiculous . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the witch . a witch professed to be able to avert the anger of the gods by means of charms , of which she alone possessed the secret ; and she drove a brisk trade , and made a fat livelihood out of it . but certain persons accused her of black magic and carried her before the judges , and demanded that she should be put to death for dealings with the devil . she was found guilty and condemned to death : and one of the judges said to her as she was leaving the dock , \" you say you can avert the anger of the gods . how comes it , then , that you have failed to disarm the enmity of men ? \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the old man and death . an old man cut himself a bundle of faggots in a wood and started to carry them home . he had a long way to go , and was tired out before he had got much more than half - way . casting his burden on the ground , he called upon death to come and release him from his life of toil . the words were scarcely out of his mouth when , much to his dismay , death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him . he was almost frightened out of his wits , but he had enough presence of mind to stammer out , \" good sir , if you\\'d be so kind , pray help me up with my burden again . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the miser . a miser sold everything he had , and melted down his hoard of gold into a single lump , which he buried secretly in a field . every day he went to look at it , and would sometimes spend long hours gloating over his treasure . one of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot , and one day watched him and discovered his secret . waiting his opportunity , he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it . next day the miser visited the place as usual , and , finding his treasure gone , fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss . in this condition he was seen by one of his neighbours , who asked him what his trouble was . the miser told him of his misfortune ; but the other replied , \" don\\'t take it so much to heart , my friend ; put a brick into the hole , and take a look at it every day : you won\\'t be any worse off than before , for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use to you . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the foxes and the river . a number of foxes assembled on the bank of a river and wanted to drink ; but the current was so strong and the water looked so deep and dangerous that they didn\\'t dare to do so , but stood near the edge encouraging one another not to be afraid . at last one of them , to shame the rest , and show how brave he was , said , \" i am not a bit frightened ! see , i\\'ll step right into the water ! \" he had no sooner done so than the current swept him off his feet . when the others saw him being carried down - stream they cried , \" don\\'t go and leave us ! come back and show us where we too can drink with safety . \" but he replied , \" i\\'m afraid i can\\'t yet : i want to go to the seaside , and this current will take me there nicely . when i come back i\\'ll show you with pleasure . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the horse and the stag . there was once a horse who used to graze in a meadow which he had all to himself . but one day a stag came into the meadow , and said he had as good a right to feed there as the horse , and moreover chose all the best places for himself . the horse , wishing to be revenged upon his unwelcome visitor , went to a man and asked if he would help him to turn out the stag . \" yes , \" said the man , \" i will by all means ; but i can only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on your back . \" the horse agreed to this , and the two together very soon turned the stag out of the pasture : but when that was done , the horse found to his dismay that in the man he had got a master for good . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the bramble . in making his way through a hedge a fox missed his footing and caught at a bramble to save himself from falling . naturally , he got badly scratched , and in disgust he cried to the bramble , \" it was your help i wanted , and see how you have treated me ! i\\'d sooner have fallen outright . \" the bramble , interrupting him , replied , \" you must have lost your wits , my friend , to catch at me , who am myself always catching at others . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the snake . a snake , in crossing a river , was carried away by the current , but managed to wriggle on to a bundle of thorns which was floating by , and was thus carried at a great rate down - stream . a fox caught sight of it from the bank as it went whirling along , and called out , \" gad ! the passenger fits the ship ! \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion , the fox , and the stag . a lion lay sick in his den , unable to provide himself with food . so he said to his friend the fox , who came to ask how he did , \" my good friend , i wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big stag , who lives there , to come to my den : i have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag\\'s heart and brains . \" the fox went to the wood and found the stag and said to him , \" my dear sir , you\\'re in luck . you know the lion , our king : well , he\\'s at the point of death , and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts . i hope you won\\'t forget that i was the first to bring you the good news . and now i must be going back to him ; and , if you take my advice , you\\'ll come too and be with him at the last . \" the stag was highly flattered , and followed the fox to the lion\\'s den , suspecting nothing . no sooner had he got inside than the lion sprang upon him , but he misjudged his spring , and the stag got away with only his ears torn , and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood . the fox was much mortified , and the lion , too , was dreadfully disappointed , for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness . so he begged the fox to have another try at coaxing the stag to his den . \" it\\'ll be almost impossible this time , \" said the fox , \" but i\\'ll try \" ; and off he went to the wood a second time , and found the stag resting and trying to recover from his fright . as soon as he saw the fox he cried , \" you scoundrel , what do you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that ? take yourself off , or i\\'ll do you to death with my horns . \" but the fox was entirely shameless . \" what a coward you were , \" said he ; \" surely you didn\\'t think the lion meant any harm ? why , he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit . you have rather disgusted him , and i\\'m not sure he won\\'t make the wolf king instead , unless you come back at once and show you\\'ve got some spirit . i promise you he won\\'t hurt you , and i will be your faithful servant . \" the stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return , and this time the lion made no mistake , but overpowered him , and feasted right royally upon his carcase . the fox , meanwhile , watched his chance and , when the lion wasn\\'t looking , filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble . presently the lion began searching for them , of course without success : and the fox , who was watching him , said , \" i don\\'t think it\\'s much use your looking for the brains : a creature who twice walked into a lion\\'s den can\\'t have got any . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man who lost his spade . a man was engaged in digging over his vineyard , and one day on coming to work he missed his spade . thinking it may have been stolen by one of his labourers , he questioned them closely , but they one and all denied any knowledge of it . he was not convinced by their denials , and insisted that they should all go to the town and take oath in a temple that they were not guilty of the theft . this was because he had no great opinion of the simple country deities , but thought that the thief would not pass undetected by the shrewder gods of the town . when they got inside the gates the first thing they heard was the town crier proclaiming a reward for information about a thief who had stolen something from the city temple . \" well , \" said the man to himself , \" it strikes me i had better go back home again . if these town gods can\\'t detect the thieves who steal from their own temples , it\\'s scarcely likely they can tell me who stole my spade . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the partridge and the fowler . a fowler caught a partridge in his nets , and was just about to wring its neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and said , \" do not kill me , but let me live and i will repay you for your kindness by decoying other partridges into your nets . \" \" no , \" said the fowler , \" i will not spare you . i was going to kill you anyhow , and after that treacherous speech you thoroughly deserve your fate . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the runaway slave . a slave , being discontented with his lot , ran away from his master . he was soon missed by the latter , who lost no time in mounting his horse and setting out in pursuit of the fugitive . he presently came up with him , and the slave , in the hope of avoiding capture , slipped into a treadmill and hid himself there . \" aha , \" said his master , \" that\\'s the very place for you , my man ! \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hunter and the woodman . a hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion , and , catching sight presently of a woodman engaged in felling a tree , he went up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion\\'s footprints anywhere about , or if he knew where his den was . the woodman answered , \" if you will come with me , i will show you the lion himself . \" the hunter turned pale with fear , and his teeth chattered as he replied , \" oh , i\\'m not looking for the lion , thanks , but only for his tracks . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the serpent and the eagle . an eagle swooped down upon a serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it . but the serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment ; and then there ensued a life - and - death struggle between the two . a countryman , who was a witness of the encounter , came to the assistance of the eagle , and succeeded in freeing him from the serpent and enabling him to escape . in revenge the serpent spat some of his poison into the man\\'s drinking - horn . heated with his exertions , the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn , when the eagle knocked it out of his hand , and spilled its contents upon the ground . one good turn deserves another . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the rogue and the oracle . a rogue laid a wager that he would prove the oracle at delphi to be untrustworthy by procuring from it a false reply to an inquiry by himself . so he went to the temple on the appointed day with a small bird in his hand , which he concealed under the folds of his cloak , and asked whether what he held in his hand were alive or dead . if the oracle said \" dead , \" he meant to produce the bird alive : if the reply was \" alive , \" he intended to wring its neck and show it to be dead . but the oracle was one too many for him , for the answer he got was this : \" stranger , whether the thing that you hold in your hand be alive or dead is a matter that depends entirely on your own will . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the horse and the ass . a horse , proud of his fine harness , met an ass on the high - road . as the ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass , the horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster . the ass held his peace , but did not forget the other\\'s insolence . not long afterwards the horse became broken - winded , and was sold by his owner to a farmer . one day , as he was drawing a dung - cart , he met the ass again , who in turn derided him and said , \" aha ! you never thought to come to this , did you , you who were so proud ! where are all your gay trappings now ? \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dog chasing a wolf . a dog was chasing a wolf , and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow he was , and what strong legs he had , and how quickly they covered the ground . \" now , there\\'s this wolf , \" he said to himself , \" what a poor creature he is : he\\'s no match for me , and he knows it and so he runs away . \" but the wolf looked round just then and said , \" don\\'t you imagine i\\'m running away from you , my friend : it\\'s your master i\\'m afraid of . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | grief and his due . when jupiter was assigning the various gods their privileges , it so happened that grief was not present with the rest : but when all had received their share , he too entered and claimed his due . jupiter was at a loss to know what to do , for there was nothing left for him . however , at last he decided that to him should belong the tears that are shed for the dead . thus it is the same with grief as it is with the other gods . the more devoutly men render to him his due , the more lavish is he of that which he has to bestow . it is not well , therefore , to mourn long for the departed ; else grief , whose sole pleasure is in such mourning , will be quick to send fresh cause for tears . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hawk , the kite , and the pigeons . the pigeons in a certain dovecote were persecuted by a kite , who every now and then swooped down and carried off one of their number . so they invited a hawk into the dovecote to defend them against their enemy . but they soon repented of their folly : for the hawk killed more of them in a day than the kite had done in a year . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the woman and the farmer . a woman , who had lately lost her husband , used to go every day to his grave and lament her loss . a farmer , who was engaged in ploughing not far from the spot , set eyes upon the woman and desired to have her for his wife : so he left his plough and came and sat by her side , and began to shed tears himself . she asked him why he wept ; and he replied , \" i have lately lost my wife , who was very dear to me , and tears ease my grief . \" \" and i , \" said she , \" have lost my husband . \" and so for a while they mourned in silence . then he said , \" since you and i are in like case , shall we not do well to marry and live together ? i shall take the place of your dead husband , and you , that of my dead wife . \" the woman consented to the plan , which indeed seemed reasonable enough : and they dried their tears . meanwhile , a thief had come and stolen the oxen which the farmer had left with his plough . on discovering the theft , he beat his breast and loudly bewailed his loss . when the woman heard his cries , she came and said , \" why , are you weeping still ? \" to which he replied , \" yes , and i mean it this time . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | prometheus and the making of man . at the bidding of jupiter , prometheus set about the creation of man and the other animals . jupiter , seeing that mankind , the only rational creatures , were far outnumbered by the irrational beasts , bade him redress the balance by turning some of the latter into men . prometheus did as he was bidden , and this is the reason why some people have the forms of men but the souls of beasts . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the swallow and the crow . a swallow was once boasting to a crow about her birth . \" i was once a princess , \" said she , \" the daughter of a king of athens , but my husband used me cruelly , and cut out my tongue for a slight fault . then , to protect me from further injury , i was turned by juno into a bird . \" \" you chatter quite enough as it is , \" said the crow . \" what you would have been like if you hadn\\'t lost your tongue , i can\\'t think . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hunter and the horseman . a hunter went out after game , and succeeded in catching a hare , which he was carrying home with him when he met a man on horseback , who said to him , \" you have had some sport i see , sir , \" and offered to buy it . the hunter readily agreed ; but the horseman had no sooner got the hare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full gallop . the hunter ran after him for some little distance ; but it soon dawned upon him that he had been tricked , and he gave up trying to overtake the horseman , and , to save his face , called after him as loud as he could , \" all right , sir , all right , take your hare : it was meant all along as a present . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the goatherd and the wild goats . a goatherd was tending his goats out at pasture when he saw a number of wild goats approach and mingle with his flock . at the end of the day he drove them home and put them all into the pen together . next day the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual : so he kept them at home in the pen , and fed them there . he only gave his own goats enough food to keep them from starving , but he gave the wild goats as much as they could eat and more ; for he was very anxious for them to stay , and he thought that if he fed them well they wouldn\\'t want to leave him . when the weather improved , he took them all out to pasture again ; but no sooner had they got near the hills than the wild goats broke away from the flock and scampered off . the goatherd was very much disgusted at this , and roundly abused them for their ingratitude . \" rascals ! \" he cried , \" to run away like that after the way i\\'ve treated you ! \" hearing this , one of them turned round and said , \" oh , yes , you treated us all right - - too well , in fact ; it was just that that put us on our guard . if you treat newcomers like ourselves so much better than your own flock , it\\'s more than likely that , if another lot of strange goats joined yours , _ we _ should then be neglected in favour of the last comers . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the nightingale and the swallow . a swallow , conversing with a nightingale , advised her to quit the leafy coverts where she made her home , and to come and live with men , like herself , and nest under the shelter of their roofs . but the nightingale replied , \" time was when i too , like yourself , lived among men : but the memory of the cruel wrongs i then suffered makes them hateful to me , and never again will i approach their dwellings . \" . the scene of past sufferings revives painful memories . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the traveller and fortune . a traveller , exhausted with fatigue after a long journey , sank down at the very brink of a deep well and presently fell asleep . he was within an ace of falling in , when dame fortune appeared to him and touched him on the shoulder , cautioning him to move further away . \" wake up , good sir , i pray you , \" she said ; \" had you fallen into the well , the blame would have been thrown not on your own folly but on me , fortune . \" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | '"
